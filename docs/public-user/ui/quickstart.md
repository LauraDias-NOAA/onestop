# User Interface Quick Start Guide
The OneStop UI is designed to be useful and intuitive for a large cross-section of end-users: scientists, researchers, students, and the average person in general. It's a great starting point when trying to discover and download scientific data, and is designed to help users find more specific services of interest as well.

In terms of the UI, the best way to get started is really just to dive right in! You can follow along with the steps on the official [NOAA deployment site](https://data.noaa.gov/onestop/) or our [development deployment](https://sciapps.colorado.edu/onestop).

# Walkthrough
## Step One: The Initial Search Query
From the landing page, there are 3 ways to populate the initial text query: 
1. Enter your query in the text bar, followed by `Enter` or clicking the magnifying glass button. 
1. Click one of the options under the `Explore Popular Topics` header.
1. Click one of the options on the `Featured Data Sets` carousel.

We'll use the query text field and search for the term `water level`.

**Note**: Check out that dashed line around the `Weather` icon. The UI fully supports keyboard navigation, and the current focus is frequently denoted by a dashed line (other visual focus cues are sometimes used when the dashed line is otherwise more difficult to discern). The next guide in this series covers keyboard navigation in depth.

## Step Two: Assessing Initial Collection Results
You've started exploring the data at last! The first results you encounter are collection results. Collections are a high level grouping of similar data files -- they can represent all the data gathered by a single instrument on a satellite to a poster about a hurricane, and everything in between. Depending on the specificity of your query, the number of collection results returned can vary widely. 

As you can see below, we found 482 collections matching our search term, and they seem to all be quite different...
