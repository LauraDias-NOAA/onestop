# Metadata Manager Navigation Guide
As a metadata manager for a OneStop deployment, you will likely be tasked with loading metadata into OneStop and making sure it is searchable and rendering well in the UI. Since this role requires interacting with several components of the OneStop ecosystem, you are encouraged to start with an architectural overview. The guide then takes you through your three most common goals as a metadata manager: creating, loading, and maintaining your metadata within the OneStop system.

Please note that for the Metadata Manager documentation, we are assuming that you will use existing tools to integrate your metadata with OneStop and that you will not be responsible for connecting your own software to the underlying components. If you _do_ need information pertaining to connecting your own software with a OneStop deployment, you can find it in the [External Developer Navigation Guide](external-developer.md).

Take a look at our navigational suggestions below, or simply click the `Next` link at the bottom of the page to start at the top and work your way down.
